Nebulin
Nebulin is a social prediction and betting platform for you and your friends. Inspired by the concept behind Polymarket, Nebulin transforms any question, topic, or event into an interactive marketplace where you and your circle can wager on outcomes, share predictions, and discuss possible futures—all in a private, trust-based environment.

Key Features
Private Prediction Markets: Create and participate in prediction markets exclusive to your friend groups. No strangers, no noise—just the people you know and trust.
Frictionless Creation: Spin up a new market in seconds. Want to settle a debate, predict the outcome of tonight’s game, or guess who’s going to win the next election? Nebulin has you covered.
Social Engagement: Chat with friends, comment on predictions, and spark lively discussions. Nebulin isn’t just about winning bets, it’s about fostering community insights and conversation.
User-Friendly UI: Navigate through markets easily, discover trending predictions among your friends, and track your performance over time.
Trusted Settlement: Resolve bets with transparency. Group members can verify outcomes together, ensuring fairness and building trust.
How It Works
Create a Market:
Propose an event or question—such as “Will the local soccer team win Saturday’s match?”—and set it as a new market. Define the deadline, possible outcomes, and initial terms.

Invite Your Friends:
Send private invites to friends you want to participate. Nebulin is all about tight-knit communities where everyone’s input counts.

Place Bets & Discuss:
Bet on the outcome you think is most likely. Support your choice with arguments, share sources, and try to sway others to your perspective. Keep it friendly, but competitive!

Wait for Outcome & Settle:
When the event concludes, verify the outcome with the group. The winning bettors claim their share, and everyone walks away with new insights and bragging rights.

Why Nebulin?
For the People You Care About:
Other platforms are massive, public, and often impersonal. Nebulin ensures your markets remain among friends—fostering trust, reducing noise, and encouraging genuine conversation.

Insights, Not Just Winnings:
While you can earn bragging rights (and maybe some currency, if implemented) for being right, the real value is in the discussions and knowledge gained from each market.

Transparency & Control:
Each group decides how outcomes are determined. Vote, consensus, or a trusted source—your group controls the rules, ensuring fair and reliable settlements.
